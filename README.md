# MyChildVaccine

My child vaccines is based on MVC framework and is built using codeigniter. It has dynamic as well as static pages and 2 types of user access, based on the person who is logging in.

Flow of the website:

Intro page is the very first page which all users will see. Here the users can sign-up or login which would navigate them to the home page. (If an admin logs in, he/she would see an admin dashboard instead of the home page.)
From the home page, the user can navigate and register their children, update their details, add vaccines given, etc.

The website also has a compare functionality which allows parents to compare the side effects of a particular vaccine with other children from the database.

The admin adds different vaccines, their side effects and can manage the webiste.
